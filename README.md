# Selecting an Analog Sample
Adapted from Cat Fielder.

# Installation
Directly from Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/toribonidie/analog_stars
```

# Usage
This code has been adapted from Cat Fielder, who used it to select a Milky Way anlog sample. Her version can be found here: ```https://github.com/cfielder/MW_Morphology```

This code is sepcifically built to work around a cleaned sample. For example, in Bonidie et al. (2022), we selected both samples from stars in APOGEE DR16 that have passed the combined quality cuts from Hayes et al. (2020) and Mazzola et al. (2020). Further, to ensure that the presence of MW stars with very high S/N spectra does not introduce unwanted biases in our measurements, we required that the S/N of the stellar analogs be in the same range as the Sgr dSph members.

If you want to work with this specific sample please contact me!
